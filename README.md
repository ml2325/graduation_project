#Hazardous Object Classification using Machine Learning
üìå Project Overview:
This project aims to classify objects as hazardous or not based on various features using machine learning models. The dataset is processed, balanced, and analyzed to ensure high accuracy and reliable predictions.

üîç Key Steps:
-Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical values.
Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).


-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Used Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for visual insights.
Checked feature distributions, correlations, and data imbalances.

-Model Selection & Training:
Implemented Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models.
Split data into 80% training / 20% testing.
Evaluated models using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.

-Results & Findings:
Decision Tree Model achieved 92.16% accuracy.
Precision, recall, and F1-score were balanced across both classes.
The confusion matrix showed good classification with minor misclassifications.
